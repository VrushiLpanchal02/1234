# Inception Movie Poster - HTML & CSS Project

## About the Project
This is a simple web page recreating the "Inception" (2010) movie poster using HTML and CSS. The page includes semantic markup, styling to approximate the original poster text style, and links to official movie resources. This project was created as part of a web development assignment to practice HTML sectioning, CSS styling, and embedding multimedia content.

## Features
- Semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>` used to structure content.
- Use of Google Fonts to mimic the typography of the original poster.
- Custom CSS styling for colors, fonts, layout, and a flicker animation on the movie title.
- Included poster image and background image.
- Cast listed in visually distinct pill-shaped containers.
- External links to the official Warner Bros. site, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb for "Inception".
- Accessible alt text on images.
- Student info included in comments (Name & Roll No).

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the project files, making sure the `images` folder contains:
   - `inception-bg.jpg` (background image)
   - `inception-poster.jpg` (poster image)
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. The page should display the styled poster text and images.
